UPDATE: (by fehlix, May, 2020)
-- adjusted to automatically recognise wlan0, wlan1, eth0 and eth1
-- set default colorN with color_table 

The conky is set to wlan0 by the clock_rings.lua script. To change it, 
--open that file in the text editor (Featherpad by default) 
--click Search > Replace
--type "wlan0" in the Find space, and "eth0" in the Replace space
--click the double down arrow (Featherpad) or otherwise execute the replacement

The color of the rings is also set in that lua script. Look for bg_color or fg_color to change. Text color can be easily adjusted with MX Conky.
