Setting up Conky OR Things to check before running...
-----------------------------------------------------
All Ways run this FIRST!! if you have not already..

Run Sensors Detect = ( "yes | sudo sensors-detect" ) + enter (OR) ( "sudo sensors-detect" ) + yes enter & so on.

HddTemp

If you want to have Hard drive Temperatures in your Conky you MAY need to edit as root (etc/hddtemp.db) and add your hard drive to the list under your brand of drive.


1 = Install hddtemp 
To run hddtemp without sudo on startup type = chmod u+s /usr/sbin/hddtemp

2 = Find your drive list. type = lsblk -f 

(You only need to do below if your drive temp is NOT working with Conky as in most ssd & m2 drives)

example = hddtemp /dev/sdb 
/dev/sdb: Samsung SSD 850 EVO 500G B        WARNING: Drive /dev/sda doesn't seem to have a temperature sensor

3 = sudo smartctl /dev/sdb -a | grep -i Temp  (Change /dev/sdb to your drive , you need the first number of the read out mine was 190)

example below under SAMSUNG
"Samsung SSD 840 EVO 250G B"        190  C  "Samsung SSD 840 EVO 250G B"
"Samsung SSD 850 EVO 250G B"        190  C  "Samsung SSD 850 EVO 250G B"
"Samsung SSD 850 EVO 500G B"        190  C  "Samsung SSD 850 EVO 500G B"
"Samsung SSD 850 EVO M.2"           190  C  "Samsung SSD 850 EVO M.2"
"Samsung SSD 860 EVO 250G B"        190  C  "Samsung SSD 860 EVO 250G B"
"Samsung SSD 860 EVO 500G B"        190  C  "Samsung SSD 860 EVO 500G B"

The read out from hddtemp /dev/sdb is Samsung SSD 850 EVO 500G B this must be added to your hddtemp.db exactly the same NOTE upper and lower case and the gap between 250G B as above..

FanSpeeds



If your fan speed is not reading change hwmon number 1,2,etc until you have the RPM reading saving conkyrc each time.

If you have more then one fan just add fan 2,3 etc.
${hwmon 3 fan 1} rpm ${hwmon 3 fan 2} rpm ${hwmon 3 fan 3} rpm

examples=

${alignc}${color}RaD-Fan: ${alignc}${color #F0FF00}${hwmon 3 fan 1} RPM
${alignc}${color}PumP: ${alignc}${color #F0FF00}${hwmon 3 fan 2} RPM

From my bar conky.
{ "full_text": "ï‹‰  * ${hwmon 3 fan 1} rpm : ${hwmon 3 fan 2} rpm : ${hwmon 3 fan 3} rpm" , "color": "\#33FF99"


OR


---------------
To run the below command you must install FANSPEED

To find out which fans you have and speed in RPM
just say no to every thing until you get the reading below then Control C to exit....

sudo pwmconfig

Found the following fan sensors:
   hwmon1/fan1_input     current speed: 0 ... skipping!
   hwmon3/fan1_input     current speed: 1053 RPM
   hwmon3/fan2_input     current speed: 2551 RPM
   hwmon3/fan3_input     current speed: 1072 RPM
   hwmon3/fan4_input     current speed: 0 ... skipping!
   hwmon3/fan5_input     current speed: 0 ... skipping!
